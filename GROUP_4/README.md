Website that once you create an account for, will put you through a simple survey to learn who you are. Then once you login it will display interesting events around your area and for those who like to stay indoors, interesting things to do indoors. For example, if you say you really like science fiction movies, the site will tell you that a new movie is coming out and here are the theaters near your location. If a band you stated you like is coming to town, it will tell you that and potentially link you to ticket websites ready to sell you the tickets. If you state you like a certain type of product, it can link you to similar products(action video game would take you to another action video game).To conclude, it would basically google the things you would google in the first place before you think you need to google them.
