<b>Idea: Recipe Pricer</b>
<p>
We will make a recipe-pricer program.  We will get recipes from screen-scraping from allRecipes.com, 
and then price them out using the Google Shopping API.  The allRecipes website contains the individual ingredients 
in the recipe, which will make it relatively easy to find the ingredients on Google and see how much they will cost.
