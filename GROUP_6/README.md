Hey, Eli/James do you got facebook accounts? It'd be easier to coordinate with a group.
Otherwise, use this:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHUWpezA7kaeZ_ArTtkECio025k3mY3bE7xmITx7kVA/edit

Write comments/notes/code/schema/etc + your name

Ok, added the html. Basic frame. Once the app.py is finished, should be easy to connect them.

We also need:
-a homepage
-a picture page (gallery form instead of slideshow form.
-maybe a search function. (reminder to self: add pic titles)

So the other person working on HTML, work on one or two of them.

Also, how does this work again? Does the site download the pics and save them for future use, or does it refresh new images in real time?
I mean, are the picture temporary, or permanent? If their temporary, then the comments and tags are meaningless.
Continue conversation on doc.
