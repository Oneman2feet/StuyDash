The Albumonator
<h3>What it does:</h3>
Using the Flickr, Wikipedia, and iHeartQuotes API, the AlbumArtinator generates random album art.
 
<h3>How it works:<h3>:
<br/>
    1. It takes a random image from Flickr. This image becomes the album cover.
<br />
    2. It takes the title of a random article from Wikipedia. This title becomes the name of the artist.
<br />
    3. It takes the last three words of a random quote from iHeartQuotes. This quote becomes the name of the album.
