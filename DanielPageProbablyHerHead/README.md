GROUP 2
=========
Better name to be determined.

<h3>What we want to do:</h3>
Use the flickr, wikipedia, and wikiquotes API to:
<br/>
    1. Take a random image from flickr (and crop to a square). This is now the album cover.
<br />
    2. Take the title of a random article from wikipedia. This is now  the name of a band.
<br />
    3. Take the last four words of a random quote from wikiquotes. This is now the name of the album.
<br />
    4. Throws everything together in a way that is aesthetically pleasing; ideally, we can come up with something that creates a unique design for each input. If we can't, all the albums will look kind of lame, but Daryl has a feeling he can at least come up with a design generator based on some reasonably large database of templates.

Shan suggested the idea; it was inspired by a 4chan game.
