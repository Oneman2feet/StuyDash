The AlbumArtinator
<h3>What it does:</h3>
Using the Flickr, Wikipedia, and iHeartQuotes API, the AlbumArtinator generates random album art that can be edited, saved and rated. 

<h3>How it works:<h3>:
<br/>
    1. It takes a random image from Flickr. This image becomes the album cover.
<br />
    2. It takes the title of a random article from Wikipedia. This title becomes the name of the artist.
<br />
    3. It takes the last three words of a random quote from iHeartQuotes. This quote becomes the name of the album.
<br />
    4. Once the album art is generated, the user can edit it and save it to the webpage if they'd like. The user can also rate other album arts that are already on the webpage, and the average rating for each album art is shown under it.
