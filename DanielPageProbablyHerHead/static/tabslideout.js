    To use you must have an image ready to go as your tab
    Make sure to pass in at minimum the path to the image and its dimensions:
    
    example:
    
        $('.slide-out-div').tabSlideOut({
                tabHandle: '.handle',                         //class of the element that will be your tab -doesnt have to be an anchor
                pathToTabImage: 'images/contact_tab.gif',     //relative path to the image for the tab
                imageHeight: '133px',                         //height of tab image
                imageWidth: '44px',                           //width of tab image   
        });

    or you can leave out these options
    and set the image properties using css
