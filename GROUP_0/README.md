<h1>Description</h1>
<p>We want to create a website that gives people the most popular songs and they can rate and comment on the songs</p>
<p>We will do this by storing a few lists in a MongoDB database for usernames, song ratings, comments, etc. We will have it access through a specific username for a person or a specific song title w. artist for the song ratings stored in the song.</p>
