Group 1's API Project Our plan is to use the Yelp and Twilio APIs to create an app that allows the user to text the name of a restaurant they are contemplating dining at to a number and recieve a 160 character summary of what they need to know. This would include Yelp's numerical rating, parts of reviews, and potentially more. The goal is to enable someone without a smartphone to get vital information on an eatery before they walk in.

<b>UPDATE<b/>
Due to the fact that yelp requires OAuth we are trying to use Factual instead. We are having difficulty with this API and as a backup plan we will do a similar project but with books instead of restaurants.
