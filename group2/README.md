GROUP 2
=========
Better name to be determined.

*What we will probably do:*
Use the flickr, wikipedia, and wikiquotes API to:
1) Take a random image from flickr
2) Title of random article from wikipedia
3) Last four words of a random quote from wikiquotes

1 becomes an album cover.
2 becomes the name of the band.
3 becomes the name of the album.

The program then throws everything together in a way that is aesthetically pleasing; ideally, we can come up with something that creates a unique design for each input. If we can't, all the albums will look kind of lame, but Daryl has a feeling he can figure something out.

Hopefully we come up with a better idea (I don't think any of us were really happy with this idea). A lot of the things we discussed were rejected because they exist already. Shan suggested this idea; it essentially automates a 4chan game where the user follows the above steps, photoshops everything into album art, and then posts the results for lulz.
