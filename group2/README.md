GROUP 2
=========
Better name to be determined.

<h3>What we will probably do:</h3>
Use the flickr, wikipedia, and wikiquotes API to:
<br/>
1. Take a random image from flickr. This is now the album cover.
2. Take the title of a random article from wikipedia. This is now  the name of a band.
3. Take the last four words of a random quote from wikiquotes. This is now the name of the album.
4. Throws everything together in a way that is aesthetically pleasing; ideally, we can come up with something that creates a unique design for each input. If we can't, all the albums will look kind of lame, but Daryl has a feeling he can at least come up with a design generator based on some reasonably large database of templates.

Hopefully we come up with a better idea (I don't think any of us were really happy with this idea). A lot of the things we discussed were rejected because they exist already. Shan suggested this idea; it essentially automates a 4chan game where the user follows the above steps, photoshops everything into album art, and then posts the results for lulz.
