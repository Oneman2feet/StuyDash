APOCALYPTIC SURVIVAL GUIDE!

Determines the best geographic location in NYC to go to ground in case of one of many disasters - hurricanes, alien attacks, etc. It uses data such as proximity to shelters, supermarkets, water filtration systems, mass transit, gas stations, police stations, as well as some other stuff in case of "special" disasters (ex: in case aliens/inter-dimensional creatures attack one should steer clear of public libraries and monuments/sight-seeing places). Will use API's from google, government, twitter, and NYC sites, and will try to also use google maps to display results.
