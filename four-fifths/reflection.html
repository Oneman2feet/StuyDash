<h2>Reflections on the Dashboard</h2>
<strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Division of labor!</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Our project wasn't well suited to division.</li>
    <li>Web design took a lot more work than the other components, or maybe the other components just took less.</li>
    <li>Remember: similar components don't have to go together. Twilio and audio editing, for instance, could have been split.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The lack of a real Twilio account is the only standing between this project and eternal Stuy fame.</li>
  <li>Probably not enough of Howard's voice.</li>
  <li>Doughnut budget totally nonexistent.</li>
  <li>Problems with mobile site at first</li>
</ul>
<strong>Good stuff</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Howard Cheung</li>
  <li>We don't like doughnuts that much anyway. *sniff*</li>
  <li>Zimmer Man to the rescue!</li>
  <li>Howard Cheung again</li>
  <li>Mobile site eventually</li>
</ul>
